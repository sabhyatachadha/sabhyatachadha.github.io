   <h10> Welcome to my Blog page where I share my opinions. My name is Sabhyata Chadha and I am a rising junior attending Dougherty Valley High School. I am so excited to learn about Web Designing. One fact about me is that I have a dog. His name is Dodo! I love Dodo SOOO much!!! When I am not at school, I am either playing with Dodo or playing waterpolo. Waterpolo is my favorite sport. A lot of people aren't aware of the sport which is kind of sad, but it is honestly so fun to play!
<br>
Anothing fact about me is that I love food. If I had to do one thing for the rest of my life it would be eating. The whole science behind making a perfect meal with the right amount of spices fascinates me.
The very last fact about me is that I am a fan of the beach I always go to the beach with my friends and family. We are so lucky that we live near the ocean. Well, that's basically all I have to say.Thanks and I hope you enjoy!
