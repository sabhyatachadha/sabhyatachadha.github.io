   <h3>  Pepe the Frog is a cartoon character that has become a popular Internet meme (often referred to as the "sad frog meme" ).  As the meme proliferated in online venues such as 4chan and Reddit, many users who delight in creating racist memes and imagery, have created a subset of Pepe memes that center around racist, anti-Semitic or other bigoted themes.

In recent years, with the growth of the "alt right" segment of the white supremacist movement, the number of "alt right" Pepe memes has grown, a tendency exacerbated by the controversial and contentious 2016 presidential election.

    <h4> Is Pepe a symbol used by racists and bigots?

Yes.

Is he, also, so much more than that?

Yes.

Pepe is as Pepe is used. It is up to the Pepe community at large to put their best webbed foot forward when interacting with those who would brand Pepe a symbol of hate. It is easy to troll the non-frog for their lack of vision. Instead, why not show that person something that makes Pepe the standard bearer for memes as a form of communication.

Memes should be used as a tool of the creative, let's keep it at that.
