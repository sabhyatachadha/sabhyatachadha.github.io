   <h3>         As Kermit the Frog sprang from the imagination of “Muppets”, the world was presented with a new inspiration whose endearing and affectionate qualities continue to charm people of all ages.
    Society has lived along with him through good days and bad and observed how he keeps a perspective on whatever comes his way.</h3>

    <h4>
                Kermit the Frog is also a dreamer and an inspiration for our own goals and aspirations.
    Perhaps a quote from him may prove his optimism,”Life is like a movie. Write your own ending”. Wow, that was hella inspirational... #inmyfeelings. In pop culture,  Kermit the Frog is often seen as a “meme” but he is a hero to me.Well that’s the tea.<h4>
